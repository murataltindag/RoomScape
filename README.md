## Summary
Two friends were exploring a mysterious building and decided to split up to cover maximum ground. Someone ended up setting off the security system and now they must work together to get out before time runs out and they are stuck there forever. This 3D local multiplayer split screen adventure game allows players to solve puzzles together in real time and collaborate to escape. There are several rooms with varying difficulty of puzzles, however there are hints available to those who need it. Each room is a different level with a different theme, and they must keep ‘completing’ each room and moving on. The goal is for the two players to solve the puzzles for each level, given hints and clues scattered around the level.

Each player starts in a different room, and must look around the room and interact with items and explore to find and solve problems. Some puzzles can be solved with no collaboration, but there will be some puzzles that require communication between the players to be completed. A player can win by reaching the end and being able to escape the mysterious building before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out before the players are able to leave, they can either restart or quit.
